# Safe Signers

Safe Smart Accounts can be setup with multiple and different signer accounts.

This example application shows how to create signers from different service providers and use them to initialize any of the kits from the Safe{Core} SDK with the required `provider` and `signer` parameters.

| Provider | Documentation |
| -------- | ------- |
| [Magic](https://magic.link)     | [Integrate Magic signer](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/signers/magic) |
| [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz)   | [Integrate Dynamic signer](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/signers/dynamic) |
| [Privy](https://privy.io)       | [Integrate Privy signer](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/signers/privy) |
| [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io) | [Integrate Web3Auth signer](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/signers/web3auth) |






This example app shows how to create a web app for using passkeys in your Safe. Please read [How to build an app with Safe and passkeys](https://docs.safe.global/home/passkeys-tutorials/safe-passkeys-tutorial) to see how this app was created.

## What youâ€™ll need

**Prerequisite knowledge:** You will need some basic experience with [React](https://react.dev/learn), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), and [ERC-4337](https://docs.safe.global/home/4337-overview).

Before progressing with the tutorial, please make sure you have:

- Downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Created an API key from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).




## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5afe/safe-signers.git
cd safe-signers
pnpm install
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. Now, create a file named `.env.local` at the root of your project, and add your Pimlico API key to it:

```bash
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY='your_pimlico_api_key_goes_here'" > .env.local
```

Run the local development server with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application.
